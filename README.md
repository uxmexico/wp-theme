# UX MÃ©xico WP Theme

This is a minimal WP theme for a headless installation that provides data to a [Gatsby theme](https://github.com/uxmexico/website).

Uses [TGM-Plugin-Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/) to require the following plugins needed for the functionality we want:

- [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
- [ACF to Rest API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-to-rest-api/)
